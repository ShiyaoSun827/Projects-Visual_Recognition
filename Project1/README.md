### Part 1: Logistic Regression on MNIST

- **Model Implementation:**
  - Rigorous implementation of Logistic Regression using the PyTorch framework, tailored for the MNIST dataset.

- **Training and Testing:**
  - The model undergoes extensive training and testing, leveraging a custom data pipeline designed for MNIST.

- **Regularization Integration:**
  - Enhancement of the model with L1 or L2 regularization to improve performance and generalization.

### Part 2: Logistic Regression on CIFAR10

- **Model Adaptation:**
  - Adjusting the Logistic Regression model to accommodate the CIFAR10 dataset, acknowledging the differences in image types and dimensions compared to MNIST.

- **Performance Goals:**
  - The model aims to achieve an accuracy range of 38-40% on the CIFAR10 dataset, a benchmark for evaluating its effectiveness.

### Part 3: Hyperparameter Optimization

- **Optimizer Tuning:**
  - Focused optimization of hyperparameters for Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) specific to the CIFAR10 dataset.

- **Regularization Inclusion:**
  - Incorporation of regularization methods from Part 1 into the optimization process to enhance model robustness.

- **Exploration Methods:**
  - Employing grid or random search techniques for hyperparameter selection, steering clear of automated parameter search methods.
